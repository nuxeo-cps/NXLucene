NXLucene Installation 
=======================

Requierements 

  - Linux

  - Building NXLucene requires GNU's compiler for Java, GCJ as
    PyLucene requires it.

    gcc 3.3.x on Linux installations appears to ship with gcj. If your
  gcc installation does not include gcj, you need to upgrade it.  The
  version of gcc currently recommended is gcc 3.4.4. See below for
  instructions on how to build it.

  - Python-2.4 or later
  
  - Zope Interfaces >= 3.0.1 (http://zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface) - if
  you have ZopeX3 (at least version 3.0.0c1) installed that should
  work too.

  
  - Twisted >= 2.2.0 : http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Twisted/2.2/

  - elementtree and cElementTree >= 1.2.6-20050316

Note, PyLucene is coming with the NXLucene distribution.

Testing for developpers

  When working from a NXLucene checkout, do an in-place build instead::

    $ python setup.py build_ext -i

  followed by::

    $ ./test -vk -s weblucene

  The test runner is a zope.testing runner. Use --help for all
  available options.

  This command will run all the tests, printing a single dot for each
  test.  When it finishes, it will print a test summary.  The exact
  number of tests can vary depending on platform and available
  third-party libraries.::

Installation

  Linux is currently the only supported and tested platform.

  Uncompress the NXLucene archive :

    $ tar -xzf NXLucene-x.x-x.tgz
 
  In the resulting folder 

   $ python setup.py build
   $ sudo python setup.py install

  This will install the core NXLucene libs within the site-packages
  of the Python interpertor. They might be useful for Python third
  party apps.

  You can now start the NXLucene server :

   $ ./start

Advanced note for administrators

  The `start` script is adding PyLucene libraries to the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to avoid you having to link PyLucene on your system.
  
  See src/PyLucene/gcj/
