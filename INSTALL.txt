NXLucene Installation 
=======================

Requierements 
=============

  - Linux

  - Building NXLucene requires GNU's compiler for Java, GCJ as
    PyLucene requires it.

    gcc 3.3.x on Linux installations appears to ship with gcj. If your
  gcc installation does not include gcj, you need to upgrade it.  The
  version of gcc currently recommended is gcc 3.4.4. See below for
  instructions on how to build it.

  - Python-2.4 or later

  - PyLucene >= 1.9 rc1.
    http://downloads.osafoundation.org/PyLucene/linux/PyLucene-1.9.1.tar.gz
   
  - Zope Interfaces >= 3.0.1 (http://zope.org/Products/ZopeInterface) - if
  you have ZopeX3 (at least version 3.0.0c1) installed that should
  work too.

  - Twisted >= 2.2.0 : http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Twisted/2.2/

  - TwistedWeb >= 0.5 : 
    http://tmrc.mit.edu/mirror/twisted/Web/0.5/TwistedWeb-0.5.0.tar.bz2
    (twisted.web is not package as a separted component)

  - elementtree and cElementTree >= 1.2.6-20050316

Note, PyLucene is coming with the NXLucene distribution.

Testing for developpers
=======================

  When working from a NXLucene checkout, do an in-place build instead::

    $ python setup.py build_ext -i

  followed by::

    $ ./test -vk -s weblucene

  The test runner is a zope.testing runner. Use --help for all
  available options.

  This command will run all the tests, printing a single dot for each
  test.  When it finishes, it will print a test summary.  The exact
  number of tests can vary depending on platform and available
  third-party libraries.::

    Running tests at level 1

      Running:
        ..................................................
        .
      Ran 67 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 14.796 seconds.

Troubleshooting at this stage
=============================

Python and unicode problem
--------------------------

Some distributions, actually Debian based..., raise the error below
while launching the tests above :

  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "src/nxlucene/tests/test_xmlrpc_server.py", line 25, in ?
      import nxlucene.testing.xmlrpc
    File "src/nxlucene/testing/xmlrpc.py", line 28, in ?
      from nxlucene.core import LuceneServer
    File "src/nxlucene/core.py", line 25, in ?
      import PyLucene  
  File "/home/janguenot/NXLucene/src/PyLucene/python/PyLucene.py",
      line 4, in ?  import _PyLucene
  ImportError:
  /home/janguenot/NXLucene/src/PyLucene/python/_PyLucene.so: undefined
  symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_FromUnicode

In this case you have 2 options :

 - Recompile a PyLucene version from source your system can support.

     You will need to replace the src/PyLucene directory within NXLucene
     with the one you will compile.

 - Install a second Python for your own programs and leave the system
   Python alone.

     You will certainly have to change the specified nxlucened Python
     interpretor in this case.

 - Use a "serious" Linux distribution such as Fedora core or RHE next
   time you will have to pick up a distro :)

TwistedWeb missing dependencies
-------------------------------

If you get the error below while launching the tests it means your
twisted installtion is incomplete. Your Python installation is missing
TwistedWeb. (See the dependencies on top of this file)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "src/nxlucene/tests/test_xmlrpc_server.py", line 25, in ?
    import nxlucene.testing.xmlrpc
  File "src/nxlucene/testing/xmlrpc.py", line 27, in ?
    from nxlucene.xmlrpc import XMLRPCLuceneServer
  File "src/nxlucene/xmlrpc.py", line 24, in ?
    from twisted.web import xmlrpc
ImportError: No module named web

Installation
============

  Linux is currently the only supported and tested platform.

  Uncompress the NXLucene archive :

    $ cd /usr/local/
    $ tar -xzf /tmp/NXLucene-x.x-x.tgz
 
  In the resulting folder 

   $ python setup.py build
   $ sudo python setup.py install

  This will install the core NXLucene libs within the site-packages
  of the Python interpertor. They might be useful for Python third
  party apps.

  You can now start the NXLucene server :
 
   $ cd ./bin
   $ ./nxlucened start

For administrators
==================

   Below are the needed steps to add NXLucene within your startup tables.

   I assume an installation within /usr/local/NXLucene for instance.

   As root :

   Create a link on the startup script within the /etc/init.d

   $ cd /etc/init.d/
   $ ln -s /usr/local/NXLucene/bin/nxlucened .

   Edit nxlucend and change the NXLUCENE_HOME value reflecting your
   installation. In our case, NXLUCENE_HOME=/usr/local/NXLucene.

   Add nxlucened within the system startup table.

   $ /sbin/chkconfig --level 2345 nxlucened on

   Server runs on port 9180 by default. You may change this within
   etc/nxlucene.conf
