Indexes optimization is done once at server startup time. 

If you are not planning to reboot the server you may want to launch
the optimization of the store on regular basis using a crontab entry
for instance. The XML-RPC interface and all future protocol
implementation provide an optimize() method you may use for that.

Having a non optimized indexes store doesn't decrease the indexation
performance. On the oher hand it can seriously descrease the
searching ones while having large store.

*IMPORTANT* : Optmizing the indexes store will require you at least
 twice the size used by your indexes store. So be sure you have this
 amount available on your filesystem before optimizing.
