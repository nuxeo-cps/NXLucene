Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- In the French analyzer moved the StopFilters before the StemFilter so that
  stemmed words are not removed (for example this was the case of "Paris").
- In the French analyzer fixed the NXAccentFilter and NXFrenchFilter to be
  iterable.
- In the French analyzer fixed the retrieving of words from the stopwords.txt
  file. The retrieving was done in Latin1 while it shall be done in UTF-8
  because the stopwords.txt file is UTF-8 encoded.
- Added unit tests for the "oe" and the "ae" latin letters.
- Added missing SVN properties.
